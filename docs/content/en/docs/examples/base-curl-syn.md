title: "Baseline SYN Capture"
weight: 70
---

## Case

- Confirm ptcpdump can scoop up initial TCP handshakes generated by `curl`, matching the `test_base.sh` regression.
- Inspect SYN packets while recording metadata for the originating process.
- Verify that a firewall is not blocking outbound TCP connections on a specific port.
- Troubleshoot application connectivity issues by confirming that the initial TCP handshake is successful.
- Monitor for unauthorized or unexpected outbound connections from a specific process.

## Command

```bash
sudo ptcpdump -i any 'dst host 1.1.1.1 and tcp[tcpflags] = tcp-syn'
```

Trigger a quick `curl -m 10 1.1.1.1` while ptcpdump runs. You should see an 
annotated SYN heading toward `1.1.1.1:80`, and the saved capture remains 
readable through both ptcpdump and tcpdump for round-trip validation.

## Output Example

```
14:17:19.288004 ens33 curl.240410 Out IP 10.0.2.15.50610 > 1.1.1.1.80: Flags [S], seq 1584305332, win 64240, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 2311066804 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0, ParentProc [bash.101064]
```
